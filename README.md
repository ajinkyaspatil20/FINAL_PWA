## 🌟 About the Project

**Maharashtra's Fort Explorer** is a visually-rich **Progressive Web App (PWA)** that lets you explore the breathtaking forts of Maharashtra. These forts were the backbone of **Shivaji Maharaj's Swarajya Movement**, built and maintained with purpose, intelligence, and heart. This app helps users experience the stories, strength, and significance of each fort — digitally.
